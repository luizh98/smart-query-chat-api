AI-powered MongoDB Query Generator API
This project is a simple backend built with FastAPI, MongoDB, and OpenAI, which receives natural language questions and returns filtered data from a MongoDB database by generating the appropriate queries through an LLM (Large Language Model).

It uses Docker to spin up a MongoDB instance pre-populated with example data (professors, classes, and scheduling), and a Python API that orchestrates the LLM prompt, executes the MongoDB query, and returns both the data and a concise human-readable answer.

🚀 Features
🔍 Accepts natural language questions via POST /chat endpoint.
🤖 Uses OpenAI GPT to generate JSON queries (find or aggregate) for MongoDB.
🗄️ Executes these queries on a MongoDB database.
📝 Returns both raw data and a short direct answer to the user's question.
🐳 Runs MongoDB with seeded data using Docker and an init script.


⚙️ Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/luizh98/smart-query-chat-api.git
cd smart-query-chat-api

3. Start MongoDB with seeded data
docker-compose up -d

This will start MongoDB on localhost:27018 and seed it with:
professor collection
aula collection
agenda_professor collection

3. Install Python dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here   # Linux/macOS
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here      # Windows CMD
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your_key_here"   # Windows PowerShell

🚀 Run the API
uvicorn main:app --reload

Your API will be available at:
http://127.0.0.1:8000

🔥 Usage Example
Send a POST request to /chat with a JSON body:

{
  "pergunta": "Which professor teaches Mathematics?"
}

The API will:
Use OpenAI to generate a MongoDB query.
Run this query on the seeded database.

Return:
the generated query,
the raw data from MongoDB,
and a short direct answer.

Sample response:
{
  "query_gerada": "{ \"collection\": \"professor\", \"query\": { \"especialidade\": \"Matemática\" } }",
  "dados": [ { "_id": 1, "nome": "João Silva", "especialidade": "Matemática", ... } ],
  "resposta": "The professor who teaches Mathematics is João Silva."
}

🛠 Tech Stack
Python: FastAPI, Pydantic, PyMongo, OpenAI SDK
MongoDB: with seeded collections and indices
Docker Compose: for isolated database setup

📝 Notes
The MongoDB container exposes port 27018 on your local machine. Adjust if needed in docker-compose.yml.
The mongo-init.js script ensures consistent test data on startup.
The system is designed to avoid general $in with complex pipelines and always use $lookup for joins.

🚀 Future Improvements
Add authentication for API.
Include unit tests and pytest coverage.
Make LLM model configurable via ENV.
Containerize the FastAPI app for easier deployment.
